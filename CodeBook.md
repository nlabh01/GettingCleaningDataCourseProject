###Data Processing:

The dataset obtained from the link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Analyzing using R, found 10299 observations, each having 561 variables. 

The activities and subject data (test as well as training)  were in separate text files.  The numbers (1-6) in the activities file were substituted with the character descriptions found in activity_labels.txt file. The combined data was writen out in tidy_data.txt.


The second data set, 'average_tidy_data.txt' was generated by taking the mean for each variable for each subject and activity.


####variable Names:

Subject  - The assigned subject
Activity - The behavior of the subject while data was collected

Variable names with 'mean' in the name represent means while variable names with 'std' in the name represent standard deviations. 
NOTE: BElow command was used to do the extraction for this codebook: 
      cat features.txt | awk '{print $2}' | egrep 'mean|std' | sed 's/()//'  | sort
